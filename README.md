Had some free time today, so built this to show how a merkle tree would work. I usually teach these in my Live System Design sessions. But some folks were interested in the actual code implementation in GO. 
So I did this.

To run it - 

`git clone git@github.com:AkhilSharma90/Merkle-tree-go.git`
`cd cmd`
`go run main.go`
